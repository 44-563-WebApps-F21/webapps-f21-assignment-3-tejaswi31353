    <h1>Tejaswi, Gannamaneni</h1>
    <h6>MY beloved location uis cleveland</h6>
    <p>Some are a bit of a hike <b>(pun fully intended)</b>, but every one of them is worth the trip. Clevelandâ€™s
        natural
        wonders are arguably few and far between, but what they lack in <b>density,</b> they make up for in diversity.
        Glacial
        rock formations, sand dunes, and gem-rich caves make this list.

        <h4>Algaritham
            Finding the lexicographical next balanced sequence<h4>
                <blockquote>
                    we discuss some classic problems involving balanced bracket sequences (for simplicity we will only
                    call them sequences): validation, number of sequences, finding the lexicographical next sequence,
                    generating all sequences of a certain size, finding the index of sequence, and generating the k-th
                    sequences. We will also discuss two variations for the problems, the simpler version when only one
                    type of brackets is allowed, and the harder case when there are multiple types.
